I think this practical is quiet difficult for me. I think SIR task is relatively easy. In the second task, I found it difficult to show 0, 10, 20, ...100 percent vaccination in one code, but I had solved it soon. After that, there was a bug in my program, and I couldn't find the reason.Later, with the help of my classmates, I found that there was something wrong with my indentation. In the third task, I still don't understand how the color was filled. In general, I enjoy this practical. Because through the process of finding mistakes, I prove my skills quickly.
