After analyzing my formative feedback, I find that there are two problems in my practical life. First, when I was reading guidance, I didn't read carefully and missed the requirements easily. For example, in practical 4, I forgot to modify my github.io style, and in practical 5, I forgot to analyze Boolean segments. These were all due to the fact that there were many tasks in the guidance, but I did not read them carefully, which reminded me to read the guidance carefully in the practical future. The second problem was that I didn't write pseudocode in enough detail, which was because I didn't write pseudocode until I had finished writing the program, which made it impossible for me to revert to the way I was thinking. I think in practical, I need to write code and pseudocode at the same time.
